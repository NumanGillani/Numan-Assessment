# Numan-Assessment
An assessment test for the position of Sr. Android Developer by Kroma Technologies.

### App Overview
This is a basic android application to retrieve the Most Popular Articles of New York Times. The coding structure is based on MVVM Architecture and using Retrofit for the API Handling. Model & Adapter directories can be found for the easy understanding of the code.The Application is designed & developed in Java Language but to showcase the little Kotlin skills, I've coded Utils Activity in Kotlin Language.

I've tried to cover all the points and complete the excercise within minimum time, it took 4-6h in total. Overall, I included multiple modules of Android Development to present my stronghold. You can have a look into 3rd party Library, Java Module, Retrofit, Kotlin, RecryclerView, QR Code, Advanced Website, Code Optimization, and so on. However, I am available for any sort of clarifications onto my code.

### Resources used in App
1. Fancy Dialog Library by shashank github
2. Advanced Webview Code by delight.im

### Suggested Roadmap for Future work
